Depending largely on plunder for their livelihood they were organized in bands similiar to mercenary companies which attracted religious zealots and adventurers of every kind. Within the context of Islamic jihad warfare, they struck fast and hard inside enemy borders to destroy war materials and morale, then withdrawing with all the loot they could carry. As flexible and highly mobile border defenders and raiders they often preceeded the deployment of much larger armies during the early Arab invasions of Persia, Egypt and North Africa.</English>

Under the Babylons the ram becomes an engine. It is suspended from the roof of a timber structure, which in turn is mounted on wheels so that it can be pushed into position. Protected within this contraption, soldiers can swing the ram relentlessly against the gate.

[TAB]In Byzantine usage, the term came to refer exclusively to the professional, standing troops, garrisoned in and around the capital of Constantinople. Most of them traced their origins to the Imperial guard units of the later Roman Empire. By the 7th century, these had declined to little more than parade troops, meaning that the emperors were hard put to face the frequent revolts of the new and powerful thematic formations, especially the Opsician theme, the Asian theme closest to the capital. Within the first sixty years since its creation, it was involved in five revolts, culminating in the rebellion and usurpation of the throne by its commander, the Count Artabasdos, in 741 - 743.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A grenadier (from the word "grenade") was originally a specialized soldier who threw explosive grenades and sometimes took part in assault operations on the field of battle. From the 17thC. grenadiers were chosen from the largest and strongest soldiers and often led the storming of breaches in seige warfare, a role later performed by sappers and pioneers. Grenades were small iron spheres, the size of a baseball or cricket ball, filled with gunpowder and fused by a slow match. The wide hats worn by grenadiers were gradually replaced by tall caps shaped like a bishop's mitre which permitted the grenadier greater ease in throwing the grenade overhand.[PARAGRAPH:1]Grenade usage declined in the late 18thC. although the need for elite assault troops remained and grenadiers were retained for this purpose and specially selected for their strength, experience and steadiness under fire. All the major European armies continued to employ elite grenadier companies until the early 19thC.. Their use was particularly marked in the battles of the Dutch Republic from 1648 to the 1790s as Dutch grenadiers wearing their distinctive guilded "bishop's mitres" saw action in numerous battles during the Anglo-Dutch wars. Grenadiers remained prominent on the battlefield until the invasion and occupation of the Netherlands by Revolutionary France in 1795.</English>

The 90-gun HMS Coronation was a second-rate man of war. A seventy-four, a common ship carrying 74 guns, was a third-rate man of war. A sixth-rate man of war carried only 20 guns.

		<English>[TAB]The Paladins (often called Chevaliers) were Medieval knights who followed the code of chivalry or knightly conduct, which emphasized courage, honour and service. The Paladin was adept at the art of war, trained in fighting in armour on horses with lances, swords and shields. They were expected to show courage, be gallant to women, defend the Church and swear off cowardice and baseness. Their origins lie with the first mounted infantry in the armies of the Emperor Charlemange as some elite warriors who wore armour and fought on horseback were rewarded with grants of land called "benefices" and became powerful captains with feudal fiefs that soon became hereditary and powerful, both in political influence and economic wealth.[PARAGRAPH:1]These knights became the mainstay of governing power under the King, raising their own armies in time of war and often rivalled the Church in wealth and influence. But chivalry and the Church remained closely entwined and the Crusades helped to reinforce the moral code of chivalry as it related to religion. Thus Christian armies were encouraged to devote their efforts to sacred purposes and the Paladins were expected to use their weapons for the protection of the weak and defenceless, to women and children, and above all to the defence of churches and pilgrims, giving rise to the religious military orders like the Templars, the Hospitallers and the Teutonic Knights. Some knightly orders, like the English "Order of the Bath" or the "Order of the Garter" remain day as honorary associations whose membership is granted by the Monarch for meritorious achievement.</English>

The stated ratio was that one Landsknecht in four would be a Doppelsöldner. A small number of the Doppelsöldner of each company were usually issued with firearms.[PARAGRAPH:1]Likewise, Landsknechts schooled in the use of the Zweihänder (two-hander), a massive two-handed sword, were entitled to double pay and thus qualified as Doppelsöldner. The fencing guild of the Brotherhood of St. Mark had the monopoly on the use of the Zweihänder after Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor granted it to them in 1487.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Zweihänder was allegedly used by the Doppelsöldner to break through formations of pikemen, especially Swiss pikemen, by either being swung to break the ends of the pikes themselves or to knock them aside and attack the pikemen directly.

A master of cavalry tactics, Alexander would hold them back during the opening part of the battle, committing them at the decisive point to charge the shaken foe, often leading the attack himself. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Alexander's father, Philip of Macedon, created the Companions, who were originally his closest retainers, picked from the Macedonian nobility. As their numbers rose, additional young noblemen were recruited from Thessaly and other parts of the Greek world. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The Companions were organized into "ilai" (wings) of about 200 men, under the command of close personal friends of the king. They generally wore the usual Boeotian helmet with plumes out the top, a dyed cloak and cuirass. Underneath, they wore linen or leather corslets reinforced with metal scales. They carried long thrusting spears and a short sword; few carried shields unless afoot. Occasionally, Alexander armed them with javelins for specific battles. Their mounts were the best that Greece had to offer - short, sturdy animals trained for war. The horses were partially armored, likely with leather skirts over their flanks and rumps. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The legends of Alexander's Companions have grown with the telling over the centuries. Though their prowess has undoubtedly been exaggerated, it cannot be denied that they played a significant role in victorious battles such as Issus and Chaeronea. And their loyalty was never questioned. For the next several centuries, elite cavalry of many ancient kingdoms would take the Companions as their ideal model.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The sling was known throughout the Americas. In the ancient Andean civilizations such as Inca Empire slings were made from llama wool. These slings typically have a cradle that is long and thin and features a relatively long slit. Andean slings were constructed from contrasting colours of wool; complex braids and fine workmanship result in beautiful patterns. Ceremonial slings were also made; these were large, non-functional and generally lacked a slit. To this day, ceremonial slings are used in parts of the Andes as accessories in dances and in mock battles. They are also used by llama herders; the animals will move away from the thump of a stone. The stones are not slung to hit the animals, but to persuade them to move in the desired direction.[PARAGRAPH:1]The sling was used for hunting and warfare. One notable use was in Incan resistance against the conquistadors. These slings were apparently very powerful; in 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, historian Charles C. Mann quoted a conquistador, who said that an Incan sling "could break a sword in two pieces" and "kill a horse." Some slings could hurl massive stones and its span could be as much as 86 inches (2.18 m) and could weigh an impressive 14.4 ounces (408g).</English>

		<English>[TAB]Condottieri (singular condottiero and condottiere) were the mercenary soldier leaders (or warlords) of the professional, military free companies contracted by the Italian city-states and the Papacy, from the late Middle Ages until the mid-16th century. In contemporary Italian, condottiero means "contractor", and is synonymous with the modern English title Mercenary Captain, which, historiographically, does not connote the hired soldier's nationality.[PARAGRAPH:1]These Italian words were standard usage in English writing of the Napoleonic times that remained current in the histories until the late 20th century; because formally-employed, standing, professional armies were uncommon until late in the Napoleonic Wars (1800-1815) thus, the word Condottiere in the English language has come to denote any hired soldier.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Italian city-states of Venice, Florence, and Genoa were very rich from their trade with the Levant, yet possessed woefully small national armies. In the event that foreign powers and envious neighbours attacked, the ruling nobles hired foreign mercenaries to fight for them. The military-service terms and conditions were stipulated in a condotta (contract) between the City-State and the Soldier (officer and enlisted man), thus, the contracted leader, the Mercenary Captain commanding, was titled the Condottiere.[PARAGRAPH:1]From the eleventh to the thirteenth century, European soldiers led by professional officers, fought against the Muslims in the Crusades (1095-1291). These officers provided large-scale warfare combat experience in the foreign Holy Land of the Asian Middle East. On the Crusades' conclusion, the first masnada (bands of roving soldiers) appeared; they were not Italian, but (mostly) German, from the Duchy of Brabant (hence, Brabanzoni), and from Catalonia and Aragon. The latter were Spanish soldiers who had followed King Peter III of Aragon to the Holy Land in October 1282, and, post-war, remained there, seeking military employment. In Italy, in 1333, other mercenaries arrived with John of Bohemia to fight, as the Compagnia della Colomba (Dove Company), Perugia's war against Arezzo. Given the profession, some masnade were less mercenaries than bandits and desperate men.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first organised mercenaries were the Ventura Companies of Duke Werner of Urslingen and Count Konrad von Landau. Werner's company differed from other mercenary companies because its code of military justice imposed discipline and an equal division of the contract's income. The Ventura Company increased in number until becoming the fearsome "Great Company" of some 3,000 barbute (each barbuta comprised a knight and a sergeant). To this, the Italian nobleman Lodrisio Visconti countered with the "Company of St. George"-featuring cavalrymen as the key fighting men, and not infantrymen. In Italy, the first mercenary army was led by Alberico da Barbiano, the Count of Conio, who later taught military science to condottieri such as Braccio da Montone and Giacomuzzo Attendolo Sforza.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once aware of their military power monopoly in Italy, the condottieri bands became notorious for their capriciousness, and soon dictated terms to their ostensible employers. In turn, many condottieri, such as Braccio da Montone and Muzio Sforza, became powerful politicians. As most were educated men acquainted with Roman military-science manuals (e.g. Vegetius's Epitoma rei militarii), they began viewing warfare from the perspective of military science, rather than that of guts (physical courage)-a great, consequential departure from chivalry, the traditional medieval model of soldiering. Consequently, the condottieri fought by out-manoeuvring the opponent and fighting his ability to wage war, rather than risk uncertain fortune-defeat, capture, death-in battlefield combat.[PARAGRAPH:1]The medieval condottieri developed the art of war (strategy and tactics) into military science more than any of their historical military predecessors-fighting indirectly, not directly-thus, only reluctantly endangering themselves and their enlisted men, avoiding battle when possible. As a political scientist, Niccolo Machiavelli mis-interpreted that condottieri fought each other in grandiose, but often pointless and near-bloodless battles. Militarily, the condottieri line of battle still deployed the grand armoured knight and medieval weapons and tactics after most European powers had begun employing professional standing armies of pikemen and musketeers.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1347, Cola di Rienzo (Tribune and effective dictator of the city) had Werner of Urslingen executed in Rome, and Konrad von Landau assumed command of the Great Company. In 1362, Count von Landau was betrayed by his Hungarian soldiers, and defeated in combat, by the White Company's more advanced tactics under commanders Albert Sterz and John Hawkwood. Stategically, the barbuta was replaced with the three-soldier, mounted lancia (a capo-lancia, a groom, and a boy); five lance composed a posta, five poste composed a bandiera (flag). By that time, the campaigning condottieri companies were as much Italian as foreign: the Astorre I Manfredi's Compagnia della Stella (Star Company); a new Company of St. George under Ambrogio Visconti; Niccolo da Montefeltro's Compagnia del Cappelletto (Little Hat Company); and the Compagnia della Rosa, commanded by Giovanni da Buscareto and Bartolomeo Gonzaga.[PARAGRAPH:1]From the fifteenth century hence, most condottieri were landless Italian nobles who had chosen the profession of arms as livelihood; the most famous of such mercenary captains was the son of Caterina Sforza, Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, from Forlì, known as The Last Condottiere; his son was Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany; besides noblemen, princes also fought as condottieri, given the sizable income to their estates, notably Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, and Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino.</English>
		<German>[TAB]Condottiere (Singular, Plural: Condottieri) ist die Bezeichnung für einen Söldnerführer, wie ihn die italienischen Stadtstaaten vom späten Mittelalter bis in die Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts beschäftigten. Der Begriff leitet sich vom italienischen condottiero (Singular) beziehungsweise condottieri (Plural) ab. Die Form condottiere entsprach der im Italienischen bzw. Toskanischen um 1500 gebräuchlichen Form. Die italienische Mehrzahl ist international geworden, die Einzahl wird im Deutschen wiederum in Analogie zu anderen italienischen Berufsbezeichnungen mit der Endung -iere geformt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im 13. und 14. Jahrhundert waren italienische Stadtstaaten wie Venedig, Florenz und Genua durch ihren Orienthandel reich geworden. Diese Städte hatten aber nur schwache Streitkräfte und wurden so zum Angriffsziel fremder Mächte wie auch neidischer Nachbarn. Der regierende Adel suchte seine Länder durch das Anmieten von Söldnertruppen zu verteidigen, die einen condotta (Sold bzw. Soldvertrag) abschlossen und dann als compagnia di ventura bekannt waren. Jede compagnia wurde durch einen condottiero angeführt. Aufgrund ständiger interner Streitigkeiten zwischen den Adelsfamilien wurde auch die oberste Führung der Stadt oft für jeweils ein Jahr in die Hand auswärtiger Personen gegeben, die als Podestà bezeichnet wurden. Die Truppen der Condottieri waren für ihre Launen berüchtigt. Sie wechselten oft die Seiten für bessere Bezahlung, und dies nicht nur vor, sondern auch in der Schlacht. Die Condottieri rekrutierten sich auch von außerhalb Italiens. Während der Kampfpausen im Hundertjährigen Krieg verdingten sich viele Söldner in Italien. Schwäbische Niederadelige, welche ohne feste Lehensbindungen waren, zogen ebenfalls verstärkt über die Alpen. Die Condottieri spürten bald, dass sie ein Monopol auf die militärische Macht in Italien hatten, und begannen damit, ihren Arbeitgebern die Bedingungen zu diktieren. Viele Condottieri wie Braccio da Montone oder Muzio Attendolo Sforza wurden im 14. Jahrhundert mächtige Figuren auf der politischen Bühne. Währenddessen stellten sich die Condottieri nicht schnell genug auf moderne Methoden der Kriegsführung ein. Sie hielten an geharnischten Rittern und mittelalterlicher Bewaffnung und Taktik sogar noch fest, als in weiten Teilen Europas bereits moderne Armeen aus Pikenieren und Arkebusieren aufgestellt worden waren. Auch begannen sie damit, sich gegenseitig aus Prestigegründen in Schlachten zu verwickeln, die meist unblutig blieben.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als 1494 französische Truppen in Italien einmarschierten und der Kirchenstaat Spanien zur Hilfe rufen musste, wurden die verschwenderisch geschmückten, aber wenig effektiven Condottieri von jeder der nacheinander einmarschierenden ausländischen Armeen geschlagen. Gegen Schweizer Pikeniere, französische Kavalleristen und spanische Arkebusiere konnten sie keine Verteidigung mehr bieten. Bis 1500 verschwanden die Condottieri und ihre Truppen daher völlig.</German>

The first known reference to ashigaru was in the 1300s, but it was during the Ashikaga Shogunate-Muromachi period that the use of ashigaru became prevalent by various warring factions.[PARAGRAPH:1]Attempts were made in Japan by the Emperor Tenmu (673-86) to have a conscripted national army, but this did not come about and by the 10th century Japan instead relied on individual land owners to provide men for conflicts and wars. These horse owning land owners were the beginnings of the samurai class and the men who worked the land for the land owners became the common foot soldiers during times of war. These foot soldiers could have long ties and loyalty to the land owners which went back many generations.[PARAGRAPH:1]The land owning samurai and peasant foot soldier combination fought in many wars and conflicts including the Mongol invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281. Constant warfare between the 1300s and the 1500s made the hiring and use of foot soldiers with no loyalty to a particular land owner necessary at times and these mercenaries or adventurers who were paid only in loot but were hard to control and not well trained and they could not always be counted on during a fight. It was these wandering mercenary farmer, foot soldiers for hire who eventually became what we call ashigaru.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Turtle ship, also known as Geobukseon or Kobukson, was a type of large warship belonging to the Panokseon class in Korea that was used intermittently by the Royal Korean Navy during the Joseon Dynasty from the early 15th century up until the 19th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first references to older, first generation turtle ships, known as Gwiseon, come from 1413 and 1415 records in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, which mention a mock battle between a gwiseon and a Japanese warship. However, these early turtle ships soon fell out of use as Korea's naval preparedness decreased during a long period of relative peace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Turtle ships participated in numerous victories against Japanese naval forces that supported Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attempts to conquer Korea from 1592-1598, inflicting heavy losses. However, their historical role may have been exaggerated since "the entire Korean fleet probably did not have more than half a dozen turtleboats in action at any one time". Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin is credited with designing the ship while one of his lieutenants, Na Dae Yong, was in charge of building it. His turtle ships were equipped with at least five different types of cannon. Their most distinguishable feature was a fully covered deck that was shielded to deflect cannon fire, and with iron spikes to discourage enemy men from attempting to board the ship.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Mali Empire flourished because of trade above all else. It contained three immense gold mines within its borders unlike the Ghana Empire, which was only a transit point for gold. The empire taxed every ounce of gold or salt that entered its borders. By the beginning of the 14th century, Mali was the source of almost half the Old World's gold exported from mines in Bambuk, Boure and Galam. There was no standard currency throughout the realm, but several forms were prominent by region. The Sahelian and Saharan towns of the Mali Empire were organized as both staging posts in the long-distance caravan trade and trading centers for the various West African products. At Taghaza, for example, salt was exchanged; at Takedda, copper. Ibn Battuta observed the employment of slave labor in both towns. During most of his journey, Ibn Battuta traveled with a retinue that included slaves, most of whom carried goods for trade but would also be traded as slaves. On the return from Takedda to Morocco, his caravan transported 600 female slaves, suggesting that slavery was a substantial part of the commercial activity of the empire.

A fletched dart is loaded into the breech of the blowgun, and the user blows into the pipe, propelling the dart out the muzzle in much the same way that a bullet is propelled out of a gun. The blowgun is an extremely quiet and unobtrusive way to launch a ranged attack, making it desirable for hunting. It comes with the major drawback that the human lungs cannot power a large or high-velocity dart. Therefore, the blowgun is limited to short-range attacks, and the small size of the darts makes them relatively harmless to a man-sized opponent. The typical solution is to tip the darts with poison, making them ferociously lethal and turning the blowgun into a devastating ambush weapon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The blowgun was used by many peoples, especially in southeast Asia and by the Native Americans.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The scythed chariot was a war chariot with scythe-like blades mounted on each side, employed in ancient times.[PARAGRAPH:1]The scythed chariot was a modified war chariot. The blades extended horizontally for about 1 meter (3 ft) to each side of the wheels. The Greek general Xenophon (430-354 BC), an eyewitness at the battle of Cunaxa, tells of them: "These had thin scythes extending at an angle from the axles and also under the driver's seat, turned toward the ground".[PARAGRAPH:1]Dismissing completely 17th to 19th century ideas of a Canaanite, Assyrian, Indian or Macedonian origin, Nefiodkin also challenges Xenophon's attribution of scythed chariots to the first Persian king Cyrus, pointing to their notable absence in the invasion of Greece (480-479 BC) by one of his successors, Xerxes I. Instead, he argues that the Persians introduced scythed chariots sometime later during the Greco-Persian Wars, between 467 BC and 458 BC, as a response to their experience fighting against Greek heavy infantry.[PARAGRAPH:2]The scythed chariot was pulled by a team of four horses and manned by a crew of up to three men, one driver and two warriors. Theoretically the scythed chariot would plow through infantry lines, cutting combatants in half or at least opening gaps in the line which could be exploited. It was difficult to get horses to charge into the tight phalanx formation of the Greek/Macedonian hoplites (infantry). The scythed chariot avoided this inherent problem for cavalry, by the scythe cutting into the formation, even when the horses avoided the men. A disciplined army could diverge as the chariot approached, and then re-form quickly behind it, allowing the chariot to pass without causing many casualties. War chariots had limited military capabilities. They were strictly an offensive weapon and were best suited against infantry in open flat country where the charioteers had room to maneuver. At a time when cavalry were without stirrups, and probably had neither spurs nor an effective saddle, though they certainly had saddle blankets, scythed chariots added weight to a cavalry attack on infantry. Historical sources come from the infantry side of such engagements i.e. the Greek and Roman side. Here is one recorded encounter where scythed chariots were on the winning side:
The soldiers had got into the habit of collecting their supplies carelessly and without taking precautions. There was one occasion when Pharnabazus, with 2 scythed chariots and about 400 cavalry, came on them when they were scattered all over the plain. When the Greeks saw him bearing down on them, they ran to join up with each other, about 700 altogether; but Pharnabazus did not waste time. Putting the chariots in front, and following behind them himself with the cavalry, he ordered a charge. The chariots dashing into the Greek ranks, broke up their close formation, and the cavalry soon cut down about a hundred men. The rest fled and took refuge with Agesilaus, who happened to be close at hand with the hoplites.[PARAGRAPH:1]The only other example of their successful use seems to be when units of Mithradates VI of Pontus defeated a Bithynian force on the River Amnias in 89BC. (Appian)[PARAGRAPH:1]One of the most notable defeats to the Persian scythed chariot was in combat against the Macedonian phalanx led by Alexander the Great. Realizing that the chariots were already a cumbersome element of the Persian army (as shock units are prone to be) led by Darius III, the phalangites were instructed to increase this disadvantage. At the last seconds before the chariots would close with infantry, the phalangites would quickly fold into an enveloping formation in the shape of an E, where the middle tab would be the chariot. By doing this, the chariots would be trapped by the bodies of soldiers it killed, and the long Greek sarissa. This particular tactic was most successful at the Battle of Gaugamela, where Darius fled.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Galleys travelled the Mediterranean from perhaps 3000 BC. The Greeks and Phoenicians built and operated the first known ships to navigate the Mediterranean: merchant vessels with square-rigged sails. The first military vessels, as described in the works of Homer and represented in paintings, had a single row of oarsmen along each side (in addition to the sail) to provide speed and manoeuvrability.  Around the 7th or 6th century BC the design of galleys changed. Shipbuilders, probably first in Phoenicia, added a second row of oars above the first, creating the biere or bireme.  This was driven in part by the development of the ram in naval warfare.  Now a more maneuverable ship could render a slower ship useless by staving in its sides rather than boarding an enemy to engage in hand to hand fighting.</English>

Ai marinai spettano le incombenze specificatamente nautiche, soprattutto la manovra delle vele che generalmente sono due: una grande vela quadra portata da un albero maestro, collocato a mezza nave, e una più piccola portata da un albero minore a prua. La bireme è il risultato di una filosofia costruttiva che mira a concentrare la massima potenza propulsiva con uno scafo il più possibile maneggevole. Per questo si preferisce l'uso del legno leggero di conifera, perchè, essendo una nave da guerra, la leggerezza è più apprezzata della durata e spesso anche della robustezza.</Italian>

Though their original purpose was to capture and force amerindians into slavery, the bandeirantes later began to focus their expeditions on finding gold, silver and diamond mines. They ventured into unmapped regions in search of profit and adventure. From 1580-1670 the Bandeirantes focused on slave hunting, then from 1670-1750 they focused on mineral wealth. Through these expeditions, the Bandeirantes also expanded Portuguese America from the small limits of the Tordesilhas Line to roughly the same territory as current Brazil.

Its official designation was the L/12, i.e., the barrel was 12 calibre in length, 42-cm (16.5 inch) Type M-Gerät 14 (M-Equipment 1914) Kurze Marine-Kanone ("short naval gun", a name intended to camouflage the weapon's real purpose).[PARAGRAPH:1]Only two examples of the howitzer were available at the beginning of World War I, and they were used to destroy the Belgian forts at Liège, Namur, and Antwerp, and the French fort at Maubeuge, as well as other forts in northern France. Bertha proved very effective against older constructions such as the Belgian forts designed in the 1880s by Brialmont, destroying several in a few days. The most spectacular success was the Belgian Fort Loncin which exploded after taking a direct hit to its ammunition magazine. The concrete used in the Belgian forts was of poor quality, however, and consisted of layers of concrete only, with no steel reinforcement.[PARAGRAPH:1]Big Bertha gained a strong reputation on both sides of the lines due to its early impressive successes in smashing the forts at Liege. The German press went wild with enthusiasm and declared the Bertha a Wunderwaffe. When used later during the German assault upon Verdun in February, 1916, however, it proved less effective, as the newer construction of this fort, consisting of concrete reinforced with steel, could mostly withstand the large semi-armour-piercing shells of the Berthas. Only Fort Vaux was severely damaged during this event, destroying the water storage and leading to the surrender of the fort.</English>

This emphasis on the infantry was the result of Spain's great dependence on mules in daily life, which in turn resulted in an inability to raise large cavalry forces. It marked the transformation of medieval military institutions into the early modern combined-arms army. Gonzalo Fernández, developed the Tercio to further increase the effectiveness of Spanish infantry against every manner of opposing infantry while remaining impervious to the dangers of a cavalry charge.[PARAGRAPH:1]At first the army consisted of units of around 6000 men, called coronelias, which by 1534 had been reduced into the Tercios of 3000 for increased mobility on the offensive.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Although gunpowder weapons were used in China in the early 10thC., the Arabs first acquired gunpwder about 1240AD and it is believed that the first cannon in history was used by the Mamluks against the Mongols in 1260. The Ottoman Empire became the first in Europe to put gunpowder into widespread use in both hand weaponry and seige cannons. The army of Mehmet I which conquered Constantinople in 1453 included foot soldiers armed with matchlock muskets and bombard artillery of various sizes. The barrage of Ottoman cannon fire, from 69 guns firing over 19,000 times, is said to have lasted for at least 40 days.[PARAGRAPH:1]Amongst these were a number of extremely large and powerful seige bombards. Bombards had been deployed by many European armies since the late 1300's but the Ottoman siege guns were especially massive and powerful "superguns", like the "Dardanelles Gun" or Great Turkish Bombard, weighing over 18 tons and firing huge stone or iron projectiles of over 2 feet in diameter. This famous gun along with many others, remained in use by the Ottomans until the early 19thC.,even causing serious damage to British naval operations against the Ottomans in 1807.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Longships (aka longboats) were sea vessels made and used by the Vikings from the Nordic countries for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age although scientific analysis of the oak timber shows at least one well known ship was built in Dublin, Ireland. The longship's design evolved over many years, beginning in the Stone Age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up to the 9th century with the Nydam and Kvalsund ships. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used world wide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with cloth flags and had lots of details and carvings on the hull.</English>
